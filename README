How to compile and deploy Unicorn under Tomcat
- Move to unicorn directory (you're probably already inside)
- Edit the file org/w3c/unicorn/conf/unicorn.properties
  Here is a list of default values for each property:
	UNICORN_HOME = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/
	UNICORN_URL = http://localhost:8080/unicorn
	UNICORN_ENCODING = UTF-8
	UNICORN_PARAMETER_PREFIX = ucn_
	UNICORN_PARAMETER_OUTPUT_PREFIX = opt_
	FILESYSTEM_PREFIX = file:
	PATH_TO_RESOURCES = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/
	PATH_TO_OBSERVER_LIST = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/
	PATH_TO_TASKLIST = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/tasklist/
	PATH_TO_TEMPLATES = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/templates/
	PATH_TO_TEMPORARY_FILES = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/temporary_files/
	URL_TO_TEMPORARY_FILES = http://localhost:8080/unicorn/temporary_files/
	PATH_TO_INDEX_OUTPUT = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/
	PATH_TO_LANGUAGE_FILES = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/templates/language/
	OBSERVER_LIST_FILE = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/observers.list
	OBSERVER_RDF_MODEL = file:/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/schemas/Observer.rdfs
	OBSERVER_XML_FILENAME = observer.wadl
	OBSERVER_RDF_FILENAME = observer.rdf
	TASKLIST_RDF_FILENAME = /tasklist.rdf
	TASKLIST_RDF_FILE = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/tasklist/tasklist.rdf
	TASKLIST_XML_FILENAME = /tasklist.xml
	TASKLIST_XML_FILE = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/tasklist/tasklist.xml
	TASKLIST_RDF_MODEL = file:/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/schemas/Task.rdfs
	UPLOADED_FILES_REPOSITORY = /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/uploaded-files/
	DELETE_UPLOADED_FILES = true
	
  Each entry of this file has the following form:
        PROPERTY_NAME = ($REF_TO_OTHER_PROPERTY ,)* [^$,]*
  For example, the property PATH_TO_RESOURCES can be :
	PATH_TO_RESOURCES = $UNICORN_HOME , WEB-INF/resources/
  Which will produce the path /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/resources/ , provided that UNICORN_HOME is set to /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/
  The only property you should have to set is UNICORN_URL, since Unicorn+Tomcat will guess the others, such as UNICORN_HOME and adapt them automagically to your configuration. For example, once you've set UNICORN_URL, URL_TO_TEMPORARY_FILES sould automatically point to the correct directory of this server.
- Eventually, edit the file log4j.xml th change the logging behaviour
- Edit the file resources/observers.list to add observers
- Edit the files under resources/tasklist to create your own tasklist
- > ant war
- As root, copy the file resources/tomcat_policy in the policy directory of tomcat (/etc/tomcat5/policy.d for Debian) and eventually edit it to fit your needs.
  Note that this file is very important because it will give permissions to read and write files under unicorn servlet dir, but also to connect to distant hosts (observers).
- Finally, place the generated unicorn.war in your tomcat webapps directory (as root) and wait for it to auto-deploy or deploy it through the tomcat manager. 
  At the end of the deployment, some files should be created in the unicorn webapp directory such as index.en.html and en_parameters.js. 
  These are the auto-generated index files from the tasklist and observers. If they are not created, it's not normal. Check all the previous steps and see in the WEB-INF/logs/packages/info.log if the properties are correctly set.
  If these files have been created, then, you could access Unicorn through index.en.html (it could be wise to rename it as index.html) and begin checking all sorts of documents :)
- If no files have been created try to add "-Dunicorn.conf=/absolute/path/to/org/w3c/unicorn/conf/" to your jvm parameters (especially needed if you install unicorn on Jigsaw)


N.B.: This is an alpha test, theres are probably many bugs and features lacking. If you find any problem, please report to qa-dev@w3.org list.
N.B.2: Direct input size seems to be limited be Tomcat and/or browsers. So, big inputs won't work


How does the log works :
Under Tomcat logs files are on "webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/logs/".
There are split in two directory :
	- "level" where log are split in one file by log level (trace, debug, info, warning and error).
	- "package" where log are split by package where they come from. There are also one file called "all.log" which
		contains all logs informations.
